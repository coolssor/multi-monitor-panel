# Multi-monitor panel

## About

As the name of the extension implies, this enables the display of the top panel in GNOME on all monitors, rather than just the primary one.

This is a fork of [lazanet/multi-monitors-add-on](https://github.com/lazanet/multi-monitors-add-on), which is a fork of [spin83/multi-monitors-add-on](https://github.com/spin83/multi-monitors-add-on), which was inspired by [darkxst/multiple-monitor-panels](https://github.com/darkxst/multiple-monitor-panels). Hell of a history.

This particular fork enables functionality for GNOME 47/48, and has some planned additional features on top.

## Installation
### Single-line installer

`git clone https://github.com/coolssor/multi-monitor-panel && cd multi-monitor-panel && cp -r multi-monitor-panel@coolssor ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`

Once completed, restart the shell (log out and back in, or run `killall -HUP gnome-shell`), then enable the extension.

## Planned features
 - Integration with other extensions:
    - [Open Bar](https://github.com/neuromorph/openbar) (theming, floating panel, etc)
    - [Hide Top Bar](https://gitlab.gnome.org/tuxor1337/hidetopbar) (Intellihide)
    - Re-do translation (because I need to learn how to do it properly)
